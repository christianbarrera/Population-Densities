# Population-Densities

An interactive map showing the population density of each country based on people/km^2.  The data has been cleaned to disregard small city states with high densities, such as Monaco or Singapore, that distort the map.  

Final interactive map plot is available here https://chart-studio.plot.ly/~keedanbarrera/16.  Plotly is not supported in Github.
