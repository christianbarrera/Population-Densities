# Population-Densities

An interactive map showing the population density of each country based on people/km^2.  This data is taken from the CIA World Factbook that contains information about every country.  Specifically, this project is focused on population and land size information.  The data has been cleaned to disregard small city states with extremely high densities, such as Monaco or Singapore, that distort the map.  

Final interactive map plot is available here https://chart-studio.plot.ly/~keedanbarrera/16.  Plotly is not supported in Github.
